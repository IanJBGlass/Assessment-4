//
// Add a function called schoolDescription to the School class that will print out "\(name of school) was founded in \(the year it was built) and has \(number of students) currently in attendance"

 let basicSchool = School(schoolName: "School Somewhere", numberOfStudents: 100, notPublic: false, yearBuilt: 2000)

basicSchool.schoolDescription()

let highSchool = HighSchool(schoolName: "Nowhere High", numberOfStudents: 300, notPublic: false, yearBuilt: 1990, mascot: "Tumbleweed", rival: "Somewhere High", rivalMascot: "Leaf Blower")

//BONUS: Create a new Date() object that represents the current date. Create a date formatter and set the custom date format for it. Use the date formatter to create a formatted String from the date object, and print the formatted String.

let currentDate = Date()
let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
dateFormatter.dateFormat = "MMM d, yyyy"

print(dateFormatter.string(from: currentDate))
